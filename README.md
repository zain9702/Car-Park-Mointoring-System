# Car-Park-Mointoring-System
This is a University Embedded C project 

In this Project, EASYPIC6 development board which include PIC16887 microcontroller, will be used to control the features of the car park elements, by using programming functions that are provided by MIKROC software libraries. These functions such as Button, EEPROM, and LCD functions will be inserted on the program code using the statements of C language, to complete the operations of the cark park system.
